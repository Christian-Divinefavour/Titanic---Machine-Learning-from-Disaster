# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

With 77% accuracy on logistic regressor model and 62% accuracy on ANN model, this project from Kaggle.com predicts the survival rate of some pasengers that boarded the titanic in 1912. 

I've commented expressively on each major step I took in getting my results and also infer that the logistic regressor model is best for this.

You have any useful tip to make it better? feel free to edit.
